# Generic Tagged Arrays (GTA)

The GTA project provides a file format called Generic Tagged Arrays and
consists of two parts:
- libgta, a library that reads and writes GTA files, with interfaces in C and C++
- gtatool, a tool that manipulates GTAs and converts GTAs to and from other file formats

See the [project web page](https://marlam.de/gta).
