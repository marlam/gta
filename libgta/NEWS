Version 1.2.0:
- Compression is now deprecated. The library is built without support for
  compression by default and cannot read compressed GTA files. You can enable
  compression with the --with-compression configure option to be able to read
  compressed GTA files, but even then the library will write all files
  uncompressed.
- Building with the autoconf configure script is now deprecated. It is still
  supported, but will be removed in a future version. Building with CMake is
  recommended.
