# When a shared libgta library is built, the libgta.la file causes unnecessary
# direct linking of the application with liblzma, libbz2, libz. This is bad
# because the application then unnecessarily depends on the .so versions of
# these libraries, even though it does not use their interfaces directly. Direct
# linking with these libraries is only necessary for the static libgta library.
#
# Pkg-config solves this by providing both a Libs and Libs.private field, where
# Libs.private is only used for static linking.
#
# As of 2010-04-29, libtool has no fix for this problem. Therefore we just
# remove the libgta.la file by default if a shared library is built. This can
# be overriden by a configure option (--enable-la-file).
